IMPORTANT POINTS
----------------

i> The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element.

** In transform-origin property we have to mention the cordinates from where our element starts growing

Ex- If we mention 0 0 then it grows from top left corner and grows towards the right side

If we mention 100% 100% then it grows from bottom right corner to other sides (left side)

ii> alpha chaining in rgba property reduces the intensity of the
color. An alpha channel is a grayscale channel that indicates how transparent a pixel is. It's used to create images with transparent or semi-transparent areas. 

iii> opacity of an element refers to the transparency level

opacity vs alpha channel
------------------------

alpha channel can only make the background transparent

opacity can make the whole element including the content transparent
