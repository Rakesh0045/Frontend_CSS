FLEXBOX SUMMARY:

* display: flex --> makes all elements along with its direct child as block level. ADVANTAGE --> We can give height and width to block elements

* The parent for which display:flex is given is --> "Flex Container" & all it's immediate child are --> "Flex items". Flexbox parent ki margin aur padding ko maintain krke utna space leave krke start hoti hai.

* If flexbox doesn't have available width then it shrinks all the flex items proportionately by equal %

NOTE:

* width: max-content --> Increases the width so as to fix all the content in 1 line

* width: min-content --> Shrinks the width as much as it can. width = size of longest word in paragraph
