Summary:

1. We use padding because to generate space around an element's content  

2. Border by default color set as our text color, but we can overright it.

3. when we add padding & border the overral width of the box will increse , to avoid that we can use one property (box-sizing: border-box;) . 

4. Margin will not affect our inner content. it apply in the outside of the box.

5. for making circle using border radius property, user should must apply width & height.

6. The outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
